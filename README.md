# Pando

Pando is a work in progress, general purpose graph editor.
The long term vision for the project can be found [here](https://kaylees.dev/trio/hemlock/projects/pando/).

Currently Pando is not yet usable, but has some of the key
pieces in place including a basic UI framework based on
Neovide's new wgpu renderer Vide that I'm calling
[Aspen](./aspen/README.md).

## Name

Pando is named after the
[Pando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_(tree)) tree,
which is a quaking aspen clonal colony that is thought to be
the largest single connected organism in the world.
